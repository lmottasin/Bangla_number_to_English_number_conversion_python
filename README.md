# Bangla_number_to_English_number_conversion_python_O(n)_complexity
# It is a small project for Bangla number to Englihs number conversion using Pyhton
In machine learning projects often we need to create our dataset. As I live in Bangladesh and Bangla is my first language. 
I faced some issues where I need to convert the numbers while creating a dataset.
It is a very simple problem to solve but the main issue is the time complexity. As the now of rows grows it requires more time because of having O(n^2) complexity with a simple procedure of solve.
So, Here I tried to solve this with O(n).
# This is the not optimized version with O(n*n) complexity

# This is the optimized version with O(n) comlexcity ( Also can handle the decimal points)
