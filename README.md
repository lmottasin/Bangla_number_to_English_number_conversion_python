In machine learing projects often we need to create our own dataset. As I live in Bangladesh and Bangla is my first language. 
I faced some issues where I need to convert the numbers while creating a dataset.
It is a very simple problem to solve but main issue the time complexcity. As the now of rows grows it requires more time because of having O(n^2) complexcity with a simple procedcure of solve.
So, Here I tried to solve this with O(n) complexcity
